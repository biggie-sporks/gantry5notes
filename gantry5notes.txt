    +Getting Started:
        -Access Gantry 5 Administrator using Joomla->Components->Gantry 5 Themes
        -Navigating Gantry 5 Administrator:
        
            Outlines: This administrative panel lists displays the current theme's outlines,
            giving you quick access to edit, rename, duplicate, and delete them.

            Menu Editor: This administrative panel gives you the ability to enhance the
            platform's menu by altering styling, rearranging links, and creating menu items
            that sit outside of the CMS's integrated Menu Manager.

            About: This page gives you quick, at-a-glance information about the
            currently-accessed theme. This is a one-stop shop for information about the theme
            including: name, version number, creator, support links, features, and more.

            Extras: This button opens a dropdown that gives you access to Clear Cache and
            Platform Settings functionality.

            Outlines Dropdown: This dropdown displays various outlines associated with your
            site. You can use it to quickly switch between them to edit their individual settings.

            Styles (Pictured): The Styles administrative panel gives you access to
            style-related settings for the outline. This includes things like theme colors,
            fonts, style presets, and more.

            Settings: The Settings administrative panel offers you the ability to configure the
            functional settings of the theme. This includes setting defaults for Particles, as
            well as enabling/disabling individual Particles.

            Layout: The Layout administrative panel is where you would configure the layout for
            your theme. Creating an placing module positions, Particles, spacers, and non-rendered
            scripts such as Google Analytics code is all done in this panel.

            Assignments : The Assignments administrative panel only appears on child outlines
            which can be assigned to specific areas of your site. If you are in the Base Outline,
            you will not see this administrative panel as it can't be assigned.
        
        
        -What are Outlines, Particles, Atoms, etc.?
            Outline: A configurable style used in one or more areas of your site. It serves as
            the container on which a page's style, settings, and layout are set.
            
            Particle: A typically small block of data used on the front end. It acts a lot like
            a widget/module, but can be easily configured in the Gantry 5 Administrator.
        
            Atom: A type of Particle that contains non-rendered data, such as custom scripting
            (JS, CSS, etc.) or analytics scripts for traffic tracking.
